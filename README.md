# Convoy-offers


Problem Statement

Many truckers prefer Convoy because of the large selection of shipment offers we provide. A shipment offer is an opportunity to move freight between cities at a specified date and price.

We would like you to develop a web app that displays these offers to truckers using the provided design. If ambiguities arise, use your best judgement.


Specification

Deliver a web app that queries a JSON API from the browser and renders the resulting shipment offers according to the provided design. The app should allow the user to paginate through offers and sort them based upon pickupDate (default), dropoffDate, price, origin, destination, or miles.

● API: https://convoy-mock-api.herokuapp.com
● Design: http://bit.ly/fe-hw-design-s3


Notes

The API is hosted on a limited Heroku account and may periodically fail or take a while to respond.

Use any library or framework of your choosing. We will dedicate some time during your on-site interviews to discuss your implementation choices, so be mindful of tradeoffs and alternatives.

You are encouraged, but not required, to make adjustments to the design, but be prepared to justify your decisions to a designer.


How to Submit 

When you are finished, send an email to your recruiter with: 
1. URL to your source code. 
2. URL to your running web app. 
You can use an online code editor (such as https://codesandbox.io) or you may submit a code repository on GitHub. If you choose to use GitHub, please make the code repository private and invite the GitHub account convoy-interview as a collaborator.
